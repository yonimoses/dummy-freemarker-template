# spring-boot-freemarker

A Spring boot app using Freemaker as templating engine.
This app is created with minimal configuration.

## Freemarker
FreeMarker is a free Java-based template engine, originally focusing on dynamic web page generation with MVC software architecture. However, it is a general purpose template engine, with no dependency on servlets or HTTP or HTML, and is thus often used for generating source code, configuration files or e-mails.
